<h1>Prospective Students</h1>
</div>
<p>I always welcome highly motivated students at the graduate and undergraduate levels. 
Financial support can be granted after one year of experience. This experience can be gained through courses taught by me or research projects.</p>

<h2>Graduate Students</h2>
<p>Conditions and guidelines for applying to Computer Engineering graduate programs are given at the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/graduate/cmpe">CmpE-MSc program</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/graduate/cmpe/phd/">CmpE-PhD program</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My research attracts students with an Electronics Engineering background as well as Computer Engineering graduates. Even though the Department of Computer Engineering accepts students from all disciplines, students from disciplines other than Computer Engineering or Computer Science must attend a scientific prep class before starting a graduate program. Details are presented at these links:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/graduate/cmpe/prep">scientific prep for MSc</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/graduate/cmpe/phd/sci-prep">scientific prep for PhD</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, I also offer MSc options without the scientific prep to non-CmpE students. Please see the MSc Students section below.</p>
<h3>PhD Students</h3>
<p>I always prefer working with highly motivated PhD students. PhD is a long-term work: the shortest time span is four years, but experience has shown that it can be as long as five or more years. A full-time commitment is necessary for a successful Ph.D. thesis because I start research with a Ph.D. student in the program's first semester, i.e., while taking courses. Qualified students can be financially supported through several resources. 
I supervise students working elsewhere under special conditions, evaluated case by case. </p>
<h3>MSc Students</h3>
<p>Scientific prep may not be desirable for some candidates. Those students may also think of applying to  <a href="http://www.sco.boun.edu.tr">Systems and Control Engineering</a> MS programs where I actively participate as a professor. </p>
<p>MSc students are expected to prepare a thesis proposal towards the end of the second semester. Hence, it is advised that the students will start developing their thesis ideas while taking courses in the first semester. </p>

<h2>Undergraduate Students</h2>
<p>I hold regular meetings with my research teams. These meetings are open to all BS students genuinely interested in my current research or academic interests. These students are sincerely suggested to drop an e-mail to learn about my up-to-date research topics and join these meetings. This is an excellent opportunity to decide on a research topic as a graduation project (CmpE491 and/or CmpE492), which generally paves the path to graduate school. </p>
